## What is this?

This is the source code for the app at https://www.parsemail.org/ so
you can install a locally hosted version if you want.

## Installation instructions

Here's how to install the App. You'll probably hit problems doing this
so it will help to already know Python/Django a bit. I might set up a
Dockerfile at some point to make things a little easier.

Requirements: Python 3, Django 1.7

1.) Install dependencies. Debian method:

    apt-get install python3-pip python3-django python3-wand python3-geoip
    pip3 install flup-py3

2.) Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/mikecardwell/parsemail
    cd parsemail

3.) Create the dir where uploaded emails will be stored.

    mkdir emails

4.) Install bourbon in the resources dir *if* you wish to modify the CSS
    This is totally optional.

    cd resources
    bourbon install
    cd ..

5.) Set SECRET_KEY, ADMINS and ALLOWED_HOSTS in parsemail/settings.py

6.) Download the Mozilla public suffix list. This is used to help us identify
    domains/urls/email addresses in the emails. Cron this to run weekly

    ./scripts/publicsuffic.py

7.) Cron this script to run every minute. It's the script responsible for
    removing expired emails

    ./scripts/expire.py

8.) Run the app. For example, to listen on tcp port 8000 with a fastcgi service:

    ./manage.py runfcgi method=threaded host=127.0.0.1 port=8000 \
            pidfile=/wherever/you/want/this/fcgi.pid

9.) Now point Nginx or Apache or whatever your favourite webserver is at it
